README file for The Eigth Wonders group project.

The Babylonian.py, collaborative_assignment_card_came_inst326.py (it is a misspelled version of the main file), and card_deck.py can be ignored. 
These were to test our repo and to see we can operate within the Github repo correctly.
The README files is for instructions on the game, how to run the program, and attributions within the code.
The collaborative_assignment_card_game_inst326.py file is the code that runs the program and allows the user to play the game.

To run the program, the user should go to the terminal and type in "python3 collaborative_assignment_card_game_inst326.py" from the spot in the directory the game file is saved within.
This will start the program, and the user can play the game. To start the program, players will choose whether to play against another human or the computer. Once the game begins, the cards are dealt, and each player selects from the valid moves available on their turn. If they’re lucky, they may draw a special card with unique effects. The first player or computer to run out of cards wins the game.
